    new Question("Linux was created based on BSD kernel.", false, "Early Linux development took place on the MINIX operating system, leading Linus to adopt a file system layout similar to Minix for his fledgling project.

    new Question("Blank lines occupy more than 12% of the latest Linux kernel codes.", true, "Bizarre though it may sound, 13.3% of the latest Linux kernel is made up of …blank lines. Pointless? Hardly: blank lines are part of the strict coding style that keeps the kernel tidy, efficient and ordered."),

    new Question("Ubuntu, the most popular Linux distribution, is based on older distribution called Debian.", true, "Debian was one of the first GNU / Linux that was constituted and organized as a community of developers. Debian v. 4.0’s source code contains 283 million lines of code, 7.37 billion dollar: projected cost to produce that amount of code in a commercial environment. Debian’s code base remains the foundation for other distros such as Ubuntu, Knoppix and Xandros."),
